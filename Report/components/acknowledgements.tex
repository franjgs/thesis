I would like to thank my advisor Han Xiao, for being an incredible mentor. His guidance, critique, motivation, and above all, time, has led this project to a fruitful completion. I would also like to thank Huang Xiao, who took out time from his schedule to help me set up the demo for this project. I would like to extend my thanks and appreciation to the open source community for developing libraries including numpy, scipy, scikit-learn, libsvm, and django that made this project possible. Lastly, I would like to express my deepest gratitude to my family and friends, for providing continuous and unconditional support in all the endeavours that I undertook in the past, including this work.
