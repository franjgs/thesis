I would like to thank my advisor Han Xiao, for being an incredible mentor. His guidance, critique, motivation, and above all, time, has led this project to a fruitful completion within the stipulated period of time. I would also like to thank Huang Xiao, who took out time from his schedule to help me set up the demo for this project. I also owe my deepest gratitude to the people behind the open source libraries including numpy, scipy, scikit-learn, libsvm, and django that made this project possible. Lastly, I would like to thank my family and friends, for providing continuous and unconditional support in all the endeavours that I choose to embark upon.
