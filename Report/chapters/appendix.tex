\chapter{Implementation Details}
\label{chapter:Appendix}

All the code used in this work has been maintained on a GitHub repository \footnote{\url{http://github.com/siddhantgoel/thesis}}, from where it can also be downloaded in its entirety. The root directory contains 4 directories - ``MATLAB'', ``Python'', ``Report'', and ``Presentation''.

\begin{itemize}
    \item{\textbf{MATLAB} This folder contains all the MATLAB code that was used to evaluate the machine learning models.}
    \item{\textbf{Python} The ``Python'' folder contains relevant Python code. The folder ``Python/Code/'' contains two subfolders - ``models'' and ``web''. The ``models'' folder contains the Python version of the MATLAB code used for the evaluations, and the ``web'' folder contains all the code for the web based system that was developed. This code uses the Django \footnote{\url{http://www.djangoproject.com}} framework, and contains all the scripts necessary to run the system. To run the project, the followings commands should be executed in the presented order.
    \begin{verbatim}
        cd $THESIS_ROOT
        pip install -r Python/requirements.txt
        cd $THESIS_ROOT/Python/Code/web/
        supervisord -c supervisord_local.conf
    \end{verbatim}
    }
    The system can then be visited at \url{http://localhost:10001/}. All configuration options can be seen in the file ``supervisord\_local.conf''.
    \item{\textbf{Report} and \textbf{Presentation} These folders contain the \LaTeX code for this report and the slides from the main presentation.}
\end{itemize}
