All the code used is this thesis can be downloaded from \href{http://github.com/siddhantgoel/thesis}{http://github.com/siddhantgoel/thesis}. The root directory contains 4 directories - ``MATLAB'', ``Python'', ``Report'', and ``Presentation''. The ``MATLAB'' folder contains all the MATLAB code that was used to evaluate the machine learning models. The ``Python/Code/'' folder contains two subfolders - ``models'' and ``web''. The ``models'' folder contains the Python version of the MATLAB code used for the evaluations, and the ``web'' folder contains all the code for the web based system that was developed. The code is written using the \href{http://www.djangoproject.com}{Django (http://www.djangoproject.com)} web framework, and contains all the scripts necessary to run the system. To run the project, visit the ``Python/Code/web/'' directory and run ``supervisord'', after making the appropriate changes to the ``supervisord'' configuration file, which should be located at ``/etc/supervisord.conf''. The configuration files under use can be found in the same folder. The ``Report'' folder contains the \LaTeX code for this thesis, and the ``Presentation'' folder contains the \LaTeX code for the presentation accompanying this thesis.
